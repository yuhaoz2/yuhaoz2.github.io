    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>, conducting research at the <a href="https://xu.me.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">UW ARC Lab</a>, under the guidance of Prof. Xiangru Xu. I earned my MSE in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> in 2019, where I was mentored by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/" target="_blank">Prof. Necmiye Ozay</a> and <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~jeannin/" target="_blank">Prof. Jean-Baptiste Jeannin</a>. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Energy and Power Engineering at <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, with a double major in Economics from the <a href="https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">National School of Development</a>, in 2017.

I specialize in the theoretical analysis and application of autonomous and controlled systems and familiar with various programming languages, including MATLAB, Python, and C++. In high school, I won second prize in the 2012 National High School Mathematics Competition and ranked in the top 0.1% on the National Higher Education Entrance Examination.

My research focuses on control systems, incorporating optimization and machine learning techniques. The goal of my research is to develop principled analysis and control methodologies for building trustworthy autonomous intelligent systems.
